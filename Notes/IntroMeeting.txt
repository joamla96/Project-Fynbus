Flex Traffic: mini busses, ?taxis, handicaped, rehabilitation ect.
 => What needs to be solved

Owner = Municipality => Region Syddanmark

Owner set amount of money for flex traffic ^^
Fynbus administers how the money is spent, planning routes ect

Fynbus does not own the busses+stuff
 => Makes public ten??/pecurement, presented to private companies who then offer to drive the routes

Case: Flextraffic
Fynbus sets requirements, eg. need 15 cars at X, that can be used for some amount of hours.

System plans routes (every 10 seconds) and looks into which cars are available.

Change system from hour price => total contract price.
Need to be able to document how the program works.
